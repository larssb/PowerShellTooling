TO-DO
- Build script that makes the package ready.
- I want to be able to share this module/project with potentially a lot of other projects.
- Figure out a way to install this module to the global modules folder
    -- look at how others do it.
    -- we should use a private nuget feed then we can just install from there

out-functionHierarchy:
    > also need to look for multiple functions in the same...
        >> to see if a function is being called internally inside a file
        >> and to get info out a function to see if the function itself dot-sources or imports external functions/modules.

Get-PublicFunctions:
    > Danging chars still there if function name is not e.g. > set-something() bug > set-something { <-- then { will be left dangling.
        >> Fix that.

FormatJSON type thing:
    > So that one do not have to fiddle with the nitty gritty every single time you have to produce JSON output and payload that to "X" endpoint.
